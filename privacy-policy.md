# Pastel Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 2026**

## Overview

Pastel is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your data when you use our clipboard manager application.

## Data Collection and Usage

Pastel operates entirely locally on your Mac. We collect and process the following information solely for the purpose of providing clipboard history management functionality:

- Clipboard content (text, images, URLs, code, and colors)
- Metadata associated with clipboard items (timestamps, source application)
- User-created labels and organizational preferences
- Application settings and preferences

## Local Data Processing

**All data processing occurs exclusively on your device.**

Key principles:
- **No data is transmitted to external servers**
- **No data is shared with third parties**
- **No analytics or tracking services are used**
- **All information is stored locally on your Mac using Apple's SwiftData framework**
- Data is only used to display and manage your clipboard history within the application

## Data Security

Since all data remains local to your Mac, it is protected by macOS's built-in security measures and sandboxing. We do not have access to your data, and it cannot be accessed by external parties through our application.

**Additional Security Measures:**
- Pastel respects password manager concealed types and excludes them from history
- You can configure automatic retention limits to automatically delete old clipboard items
- You can exclude specific applications from being monitored
- Images are stored securely in the app's local storage with access restricted to Pastel

## Your Control

You maintain complete control over your data:
- **Clear History:** Delete all clipboard history at any time through the application settings
- **Selective Deletion:** Remove individual clipboard items whenever you want
- **Retention Settings:** Configure how long clipboard items are stored before automatic deletion
- **App Exclusions:** Prevent specific applications from being monitored
- **Complete Removal:** Uninstalling Pastel removes all associated clipboard data from your Mac

## Permissions

Pastel requests the following macOS permissions solely to provide its core functionality:

- **Accessibility Permission:** Required to paste clipboard items into other applications using keyboard simulation (optional - you can browse history and paste manually with Cmd+V if you prefer not to grant this permission)

## Data Export and Portability

Pastel allows you to export your clipboard history to a local file (.pastel format) for backup or transfer purposes. These exports remain under your control and are never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any material changes through the application or our distribution platform.
